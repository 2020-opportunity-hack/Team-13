Dress for Success San Jose<br/>
Problem Statement<br/>
The mission of 'Dress for Success San Jose' is to empower women to achieve economic independence by providing a network of support, professional attire, and development tools to help women thrive in work and life. 
<br/><br/>
Scenario<br/>
I am Jane, a professional woman who likes to buy nice clothes, shoes, and accessories. I am now retired and looking to donate my work wardrobe to Dress for Success San Jose. The clothes will help women in need of professional attire. After I have donated, completing the tax receipt is time-consuming, outdated, and cumbersome. I also want to donate money in addition to my clothes, but the whole process takes 15 minutes. This makes me hesitant and resistant to donate clothing and money. I am trying to improve the lives of women that are served by Dress for Success San Jose.
<br/><br/>
How might we make it easy for Jane to pre-complete the tax receipt and add her monetary donation on her own before dropping off her donations?
<br/><br/>
How might we see and recognize donors at the time of donation? 
<br/><br/>
Impact<br/>
Having an online tax receipt will enable donors to drop off faster and increase our community support. Staff time will be utilized more efficiently and directed towards helping more clients.
